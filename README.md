Wyr.world is more than a Vue Template. 
- It's a fast and simple way to create a website.
- It's a good way to learn Vue3
- But yeah, it's also a Vue Template. So there's that. 

More specifically it's a Vue 3 SPA Template that uses Bootstrap.

#### See it in action: [Wyr.world](https://wyr.world)

### Why did you make this?
I have been trending more and more towards creating a simple Vue Template so I can grab it and use it right away.  My previous attempts were
still loaded with stuff you don't really need...  So I decided to revamp everything and use it as an opportunity to re-examine my process.

Then I thought, hey, I should document it as I go so that maybe people less familiar with Vue can learn something as well.


### How to use it:
You'll need to first run

```npm install```

---

and then you be able to run the development server  like this:

```npm run dev```

---


and then you will be able to create the finished version of the site with:

```npm run build```
