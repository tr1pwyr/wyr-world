                A simple Vite / Vue template using Bootstrap 5 (just the CSS).
                My <a href="https://github.com/TripKendall/front-end">frontend.us template </a>
                was starting to show its age and I needed a break from Tailwind...
                I wanted something fresh. Something that I could grab and instantly get started with.

                Unlike my previous free templates this one is a SPA - no router, views, etc.
                All the code is in /components called by app.vue. As simple as it gets so that
                it's as flexible and versatile as it can be. I'm sure I'll need a version with
                VueRouter and views at some point and will add that as a branch.
