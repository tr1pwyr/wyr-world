                If you look closely at this template you can quickly see that this madness is most definitely
                my own.  It's <i>How I Do</i>.  Quite literally.

                Unlike my previous templates this one is a SPA - no router, views, etc.
                My previous attempts at creating a tiny SPA starter suffered from trying to do too much.
                In this interation I tried to create something as simple as possible, and no simpler, while retaining
                that uniqueness that only comes from my brain.
