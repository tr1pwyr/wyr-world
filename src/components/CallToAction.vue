          If you look closely at this template you can quickly see that this madness is most definitely my own. It's
          <i>How I Do</i>. Quite literally.

          Unlike my previous templates this one is a SPA - no router, views, etc.
          My previous attempts at creating a tiny SPA starter suffered from trying to do too much.
          In this interation I tried to create something as simple as possible, and no simpler, while retaining
          that uniqueness that only comes from my brain.
