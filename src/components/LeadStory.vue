                I'm collecting and tracking data for another project.
                I thought it would be fun to share the data on the Salty Ape Leader Board.
                It's a list of what's hot. In Life.
              </p>
              <p>
                The quality and availability of the data will fluctuate as I work on the 
                other project.  Right now the *data* is just a javascript object in the 
                <code>src/js</code> directory.  I'll be adding the fetch call when the
                api is live.
